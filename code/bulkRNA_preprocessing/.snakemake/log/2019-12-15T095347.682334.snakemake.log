Error executing rule featurecount on cluster (jobid: 2, external: Submitted batch job 64303240, jobscript: /project2/gilad/anthonyhung/Projects/OAStrain_project/bulkRNAseq/.snakemake/tmp.dzimer7o/snakejob.featurecount.2.sh). For error details see the cluster log and the log files of the involved rule(s).
Job failed, going on with independent jobs.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
